Dear Open and Reproducible Data Science and Statistics enthusiasts,

we have great news: ORDS-MV invites you to a seminar on workflow management in data science, featuring contributions on Snakemake and Nextflow!

If you’re looking to improve the efficiency and scalability of your data workflows, this seminar is for you! We look forward to your participation.

## Details

It will take place **online** and no registration is necessary: [Zoom Link](https://uni-rostock-de.zoom.us/j/67548297872)

**Date:** 28 March 2025 at 1:00 pm

## Programm

**Snakemake: Reproducible and Scalable Workflow Management**

Snakemake is a Python-based workflow manager that helps you to formalize your data analysis in a reproducible, scalable, and portable way, including deployment on high-performance computing (HPC) facilities. In this session, **Christiane Hassenrück**, bioinformatician at the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research, Warnemünde (IOW) will introduce:

- The basics of the snakemake logic for defining workflows consisting of several interdependent analysis steps (rules)
- Software integration via Conda
- Workflow deployment on an HPC cluster

**Nextflow: Flexible and Scalable Workflows for Science**

Nextflow is a powerful workflow framework designed for scalability and flexibility, making it ideal for complex bioinformatics analyses. **Fabian Billenkamp**, bioinformatician at the Institute for Animal Nutrition, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (Braunschweig), will provide an easy-to-follow introduction, covering:

- Nextflow’s core concepts and unique features
- Practical workflow examples from microbiome and transcriptome research
