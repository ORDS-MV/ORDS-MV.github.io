The open monthly meetings aim to improve the exchange of information within ORDS-MV. This platform should serve for all interested people (students, post docs, senior scientists, professors,..) to exchange information around the topics of Open Reproducible Data Science and Statistics, to discuss questions, to express wishes and to make plans.

In January 2025 we (virtually) discussed the following topics:

* **Current developments in the Research Data Management Federal State Initiative of M-V–Summary of the virtual meeting on 30 January 2025**<br>After a brief update on the state parliament application about the RDM federal state initiative and some other aspects such as current collaborations with other state initiatives, the meeting discussed how the initiative can now be kept alive after the end of the Datenkompass M-V funding period. To get the latest updates, subscribe to the mailing list: [https://www.listserv.dfn.de/sympa/info/fdm-mv](https://www.listserv.dfn.de/sympa/info/fdm-mv)
* **NFDI exchange in the federal state ministry of Science, Culture, Federal and European Affairs M-V**<br>Some participants were invited to an exchange about the NFDI and its role for the research institutions in M-V which is planned to be continued.
* **Proposals for lightning talks in the next regular ORDS-MV meetings:**<br>During the meeting we discussed the following three topics for potential lightning talks and preliminarily scheduled potential dates.
  1. Workflow languages/tools such as snakemake, CWL, nextflow; *currently planned for March 28th, 1pm*
  2. Time series databases for sensor data such as temperature/humidity sensors etc.; *currently planned for April 25th, 1pm*
  3. Weather data, e.g. requesting forecasts based on latitude/longitude or address information; *currently planned for May 30th, 1pm*
* **Organisational–Moving Chat communication to Matrix?**<br>Matrix is a decentralized platform for chats which allows federation. The academiccloud now provides a matrix service that might be used to easily communicate with others especially across multiple institutions. This might be better solution than our currently used chat system. Everyone might check if they have access to matrix via academiccloud or another server. For further information on matrix, visit the [matrix website](https://matrix.org/).

Thanks to all participants and looking forward to meeting you at the next monthly meeting or event.
