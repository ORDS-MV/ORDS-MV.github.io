The open monthly meetings aim to improve the exchange of information within ORDS-MV. This platform should serve for all interested people (students, post docs, senior scientists, professors,..) to exchange information around the topics of Open Reproducible Data Science and Statistics, to discuss questions, to express wishes and to make plans.

In April 2025 we (virtually) discussed the following topics:

* **Data management framework for Python** Frictionless framework is a lightweight, JSON-based standard for describing and validating tabular data using Data Packages and Table Schemas. It enables easy data sharing and interoperability by standardizing metadata about datasets, including fields, types, and constraints. [https://v4.framework.frictionlessdata.io/](https://v4.framework.frictionlessdata.io/)
* **AI policy at the institutes**, KIDA initiative at BMEL, etc. 
* **Connect a local database to OpenAI** Create an API that queries the database and expose it via a public URL. Then, configure OpenAI to call this API using function calling or custom GPT tools to fetch and interact with the data.
* **Dates & announcements**
* 4th Workshop on FAIR Data in Plasma Science at INP in Greifswald, 12./13. May 2025 (hybrid) [https://www.plasma-mds.org/ws-fair-data-plasma-science-4.html](https://www.plasma-mds.org/ws-fair-data-plasma-science-4.html)
* Lehrveranstaltung Forschungsdatenmanagement, Uni Rostock, Dozent: Till Biskup [https://www.till-biskup.de/de/lehre/forschungsdatenmanagement/](https://www.till-biskup.de/de/lehre/forschungsdatenmanagement/)
