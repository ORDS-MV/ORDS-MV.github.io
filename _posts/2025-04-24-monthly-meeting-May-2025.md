The open monthly meetings aim to improve the exchange of information within ORDS-MV. This platform should serve for all interested people (students, post docs, senior scientists, professors,..) to exchange information around the topics of Open Reproducible Data Science and Statistics, to discuss questions, to express wishes and to make plans.

In May 2025 we (virtually) discussed the following topics:

* **Research Data Management in KI-Tierwohl** The interdisciplinary project, funded by Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Ministry of Science with five million euros through the State Excellence Initiative, will use artificial intelligence, image processing, bioacoustics and sensor technologies to record the welfare of laboratory and farm animals. KI-Tierwohl is a large collaborative project with 8 partners and establishing effective research data management requires coordinated planning, clear responsibilities, standardized practices, and ongoing communication. The book [Our Iceberg Is Melting](https://www.kotterinc.com/bookshelf/our-iceberg-is-melting-2/) by John Kotter and Holger Rathgeber could be helpful.

* **Management of sensors/measurement setups/campaigns** is an essential task in the DFG's Collaborative Research Centres (SFB) "Wetscapes 2.0". The [Sensor Management System](https://sensors-sandbox.gfz-potsdam.de/) app will be used to handle all relevant information of all sensors and data loggers deployed in the field. This application has been developed by GFZ, UFZ, FZJ and KIT as part of the [DataHub](https://earth-data.de/) initiative. 


Thanks to all participants and looking forward to meeting you at the next monthly meeting or event.
