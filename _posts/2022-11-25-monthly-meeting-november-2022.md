The open monthly meetings aim to improve the exchange of information within ORDS-MV. This platform should serve for all interested parties to exchange information around the topics from ORDS (Open Reproducible Data Science and Statistics), to discuss questions, to express wishes and to make plans.

In November 2022 we (virtually) discussed the following topics:

* Topics were:
  * Pro's and con's discussed in our institutes when using Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN)
  * Advantages of using [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/), an open source data base for time series data
  * VS Code is tracking you and how to prevent it if you use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), it is basically the same VS Code cloned from the same VS Code repo except it’s built without Microsoft’s branding and tracking

Thanks to all participants and looking forward to meeting you at the next monthly meeting or event.
