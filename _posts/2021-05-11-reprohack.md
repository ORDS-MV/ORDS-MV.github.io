With a [ReproHack](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/) reproducibility hackathon - we aim to reproduce published scientific results. 
During the workshop, you will either work as part of a group or individually to reproduce results from published code and open data. 
The aim of a ReproHack is not to discredit researchers or their work but to understand the importance of careful documentation of the entire analysis. 
You will be provided with the opportunity to work with real-world data and research software and asked to analyse different reproducibility aspects. 
Our aim is to bring together researchers of all disciplines and levels of technical expertise to join forces at the science region Rostock. 
This workshop gives you the opportunity to learn from other researchers from different domains and levels of experience.

# Th√ºringen as a guest in Rostock 

Together with the [Thuringian Competence Network for Research Data Management](https://forschungsdaten-thueringen.de/), we invite you to participate in the first Rostock ReproHack. 
Together, we will analyse an original research paper with respect to openess and reproducibility. 
The authors voluntarily offered their work as part of our ReproHack and will get feedback based on our reporting back session.

# A program for different levels of technical expertise 

We propose the following working groups for in-depth analysis of the article at hand:

* **Beginners** re-run the analyis and inspect the different aspects according to the ReproHack Checklist.
* **Advanced** users re-implement the entire analysis in a different programming language, e.g. [Python](https://www.python.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
* **Expert** users build a re-usable computational environment for the above groups with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or similar container techniques
