## Keynote: Quality research need good working conditions
The lack of permanent positions and large proportion of (temporary, third-party funded) fixed-term positions in academia leads to high turnover, especially affecting early and mid-career researchers.
At the same time, selection procedures for allocating the rare permanent employment contracts are problematic, because they often incentivize the quantity (and not the quality) of individual researchers’ output.
Both conditions together have created an academic environment in which research quality may suffer.
We argue that academic systems prioritizing non-permanent employment to foster innovation and continuous attraction of new talent create a precarious employment structure that also has detrimental effects for good research practice, for the robustness of the generated findings, and ultimately for gaining knowledge and advancing scientific discovery.
We discuss five ways in which a higher proportion of permanent positions can contribute to putting research quality and robustness back at the center of research endeavors: by (i) enabling more holistic research agendas, (ii) fostering openness and transparency in research, (iii) advancing team research, and by dedicating more resources to (iv) teaching open scholarship skills and (v) researchers’ civic engagement.

## Keynote: Five selfish reasons to join an open science initiative
Open Science initiatives promote the adoption of Open Science principles, contributing to the advancement of scientific knowledge for the benefit of society.
Next to these broader advantages, joining an Open Science initiative also benefits you personally!
This talk highlights five self-serving reasons on why joining an Open Science initiative will boost your research and/or career.
