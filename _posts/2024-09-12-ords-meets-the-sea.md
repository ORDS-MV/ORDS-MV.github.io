### Workshop: Georeferenced oceanographic data resources at IOW
**Dr. Susanne Feistel, Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde (IOW)**

TBA

### Workshop: Making Maps with Open Data and Open Source Software – R and QGIS
**Dr. Anja Eggert, Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN)**

We will explore the quickest ways to access and visualize geospatial marine data from open repositories using R. With a focus on showing how geospatial data can be integrated in a familiar tidyverse data-analysis workflow, we will demonstrate how R can be used for making maps. However, while R is powerful for data processing, QGIS could offer more intuitive mapping capabilities. The choice of tools is yours! We will use real-world examples from Baltic Sea environmental and fisheries data, and you will have the option to participate in hands-on exercises. This workshop is designed for R users at a basic level or those curious about what R can do, particularly in incorporating spatial data into their everyday workflows. Advanced GIS topics will not be covered.

### Keynote: National data for international science - the example of fisheries research
**Dr. Christian von Dorrien, Institute of Baltic Sea Fisheries (Thünen-Institut)**

TBA

### Demo: Foundation Models – Repositories, APIs and Fine-Tuning
**JProf. Stefan Lüdtke, University of Rostock, Institut Visual and Analytic Computing, Marine Data Science**

The availability of large pre-trained models (e.g., large language models, but also large pre-trained models for images or environmental data) leads to a paradigm change in machine learning: Instead of training new models from scratch for each task, researches can now re-use and fine-tune large pre-trained models, often reducing the need for training data and providing impressive results. In this tutorial, I will show how the HuggingFace model repository and the transformers library for Python can be easily used to run and fine-tune foundation models. I will also briefly discuss ramifications for geospatial modeling and emerging climate foundation models.
