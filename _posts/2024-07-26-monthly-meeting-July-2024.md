The open monthly meetings aim to improve the exchange of information within ORDS-MV. This platform should serve for all interested people (students, post docs, senior scientists, professors,..) to exchange information around the topics of Open Reproducible Data Science and Statistics, to discuss questions, to express wishes and to make plans.

In July 2024 we (virtually) discussed the following topics:

* How to connect with Datenkompass M-V: Kompetenznetzwerk Forschungsdaten Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the new Greifswald Initiative (mathematics, statistics, bioinformatics)
* Using CKAN as an internal research data management system? https://ckan.org/, see also publication by Max Schröder, Frank Krüger, Robert Zepf, Ursula van Rienen, Sascha Spors: A Comprehensive Approach to Support Research – Processes in the CRC 1270 ELAINE (https://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/863346)
* Plan no. 1: summer meeting at IOW end of September 2024 - IOW marine data at a glance session & beer and snacks on the beach
* Plan no. 2: workshop on how to build automated workflows with different tools (Git continuous Integration https://docs.github.com/de/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration, Snakemake https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/, Nextflow https://www.nextflow.io/, ASpecD framework https://www.aspecd.de

Thanks to all participants and looking forward to meeting you at the next monthly meeting or event.
