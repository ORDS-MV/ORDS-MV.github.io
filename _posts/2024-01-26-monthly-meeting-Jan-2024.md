The open monthly meetings aim to improve the exchange of information within ORDS-MV. This platform should serve for all interested people (students, post docs, senior scientists, professors,..) to exchange information around the topics of Open Reproducible Data Science and Statistics, to discuss questions, to express wishes and to make plans.

In January 2024 we (virtually) discussed the following topics:

* Topics were:
  * Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN) and a flexible solution using [LIMS] (https://demo.wiki.labinform.de/index) and [ELN] (https://eln.labinform.de/)
  * Setting up Research Data Management in a research institute from the scratch. What is a good strategy? What are valuable use cases?

Thanks to all participants and looking forward to meeting you at the next monthly meeting or event.
