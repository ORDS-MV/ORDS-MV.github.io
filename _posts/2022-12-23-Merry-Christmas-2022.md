![Merry Christmas](/assets/images/2022-12-24_ORDS-Christmas.png)

The year 2022 is coming to an end and we want to thank you for your great participation and the interesting discussions. ORDS MV lives on you and the idea of exchange about scientific and of course also less scientific issues. Whether at a Reprohack, the Rostock University Library Hackathon, our monthly meetings or any other event - we are very happy about the interest and your participation around the topics of open and reproducible data analysis and statistics.

We hope to continue this path together with you next year, at local and regional events: learning, sharing, and further developing and experiencing open and reproducible research.

You want to become more active in the network yourself? You are welcome to contact Frank or Anja: [https://ords-mv.github.io/about/](/about/)

We wish you and your families happy holidays and a healthy start into the new year.

Sincerely,
the ORDS MV Orga team
