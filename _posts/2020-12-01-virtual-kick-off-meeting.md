# Keynote: Let's become (Open) Science Champions!

**What was your reason to start working in science? To produce new knowledge? To make the world a better place?** If that is the case, you do not want to be a part of the problem in scientific misconduct or the reproducibility crisis. Even more, you want to be part of the solution and be a real science champion. In this talk I will discuss which people I see as science champions (spoiler: open scientists) and which steps each of us can take on the road to becoming a science champion.

**Heidi Seibold** is a group leader at Helmholtz AI. Her group "Open AI in Health" works on improving practices of open and reproducible research in artificial intelligence and health research. Dr. Seibold studied statistics at LMU Munich and did her PhD in computational Biostatistics at the University of Zurich, where she developed tree methods for personalized medicine and developed her interest in open and reproducible research.

# Keynote: Reproducibility and Peer Review

**Reproducible research and peer review are cornerstones of science today, but are they getting along?** In this talk, Daniel presents challenges and opportunities of executing code-based workflows as part of peer review processes. Learn what he thinks how you can, and should, change your habits today, what institutions and communities can do, and how the future looks like once research compendia become the norm in scholarly communication.

**Daniel Nüst** is researcher at the Institute for Geoinformatics, University of Münster, Germany. He completed his studies in Münster with a Diploma in Geoinformatics and worked at 52°North Initiative for Geospatial Open Source Software as a consultant and software developer. Since 2016, Daniel develops tools for creation and execution of research compendia in geography and geosciences in the project Opening Reproducible Research. He is Reproducibility Chair at the AGILE Conference 2020, Co-PI of CODECHECK and vice chair of the German Society for Research Software.
