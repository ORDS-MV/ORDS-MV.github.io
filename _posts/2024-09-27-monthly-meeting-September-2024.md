The open monthly meetings aim to improve the exchange of information within ORDS-MV. This platform should serve for all interested people (students, post docs, senior scientists, professors,..) to exchange information around the topics of Open Reproducible Data Science and Statistics, to discuss questions, to express wishes and to make plans.

In September 2024 we (virtually) discussed the following topics:

* We finalized the preparation for our **ORDS meets the sea** workshop
* We discussed about openly available resources for bibliometric analyses, for instance, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) and [Scimago](https://www.scimagojr.com/),
* Frank presented the progress of the project SwineBad, which was proposed by the ORDS team and is funded by [Text+](https://text-plus.org/)


Thanks to all participants and looking forward to meeting you at the next monthly meeting or event.
