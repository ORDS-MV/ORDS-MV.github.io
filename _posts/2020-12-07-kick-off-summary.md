On 1. December, the new scientific network "*Open Reproducible Data Science and Statistics*" (ORDS) of the Graduate Academy of the University of Rostock celebrated its kick off with about 150 participants from the Rostock science region and beyond. 
A program of workshops and keynote talks around reproducible and open data analysis was presented, see below. The results of two polls regarding expectations and potential future topics of the ORDS scientific network can be seen at the right. 
The great interest in the event made clear how many scientists, particularly young scientists, care about the topic. 
Lively discussions showed that regional networking and thematic training is very much desired, as all aspects of reproducible data analysis can be very challenging. 
This is exactly where the ORDS network would like to pick up.

# ORDS organisation 

As primary communication channel, the ORDS channel at the institutional chat system of the University of Rostock was presented. Members of the University of Rostock can join the channel, by following. Interested external researchers are invited to get in contact via the graduate academy and to join the ORDS mailing list.

As first results of the kick off, planning of new events already started. 
For example, there will be a ReproHack event where, we try to reproduce an already published study. 
We invite everyone to propose publications for this event. 
To do so, please feel free to use the discussion board in the ORDS channel or just send an email. 
Likewise, we are pleased to announce that a Python learning group has been formed. For more information please have a look at the ORDS channel.

# Kick off material 

Finally, in the spirit of Open Science, we would like to turn you attention to the published material of the kick off event.
