**ORDS-MV contributed to the Helmholtz Incubator Summer Academy 2023**

<https://www.helmholtz-hida.de/en/events/incubator-summer-academy-ii/>

We were part of the Course Package 1: Reproducibility in Science!!

"This course package introduces you to the topic of Reproducibility in Science. Coming from a metaperspective on the topic to more concrete information on how to make your research more reproducible, you can then roll up your sleeves and participate in our ReproHack- the **heart** of this course package."
