The open monthly meetings aim to improve the exchange of information within ORDS-MV. This platform should serve for all interested people (students, post docs, senior scientists, professors,..) to exchange information around the topics of Open Reproducible Data Science and Statistics, to discuss questions, to express wishes and to make plans.

In August 2025 we (virtually) discussed the following topics:

* **NFDI conferences** Many conferences take place the next couple of months: [CoRDI](https://www.nfdi.de/cordi-2025/), [NFDI4DS](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/), [NFDI4Biodiversity meets NFDI4Earth](https://www.nfdi4biodiversity.org/de/events/joint-plenary-2025/), [KIDA-KON 2025](https://www.kida-bmel.de/veranstaltungen/kida-kon-2025).

* **AI act** - Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 and how it is implemented at our institutes. We talked about short policies, longer guidlines and instructing the employees.

* **The next ORDS event** is comming! The focus will be on sequence data and is being planned in collaboration with [GFBio e.V.](https://www.gfbio-ev.de/de/). Stay tuned and mark your calendars for the tentative date: 4â€“5 December.

Thanks to all participants and looking forward to meeting you at the next monthly meeting or event.
