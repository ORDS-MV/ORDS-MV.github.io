The open monthly meetings aim to improve the exchange of information within ORDS-MV. This platform should serve for all interested people (students, post docs, senior scientists, professors,..) to exchange information around the topics of Open Reproducible Data Science and Statistics, to discuss questions, to express wishes and to make plans.

In March 2024 we (virtually) discussed the following topics:

* Labinform ELN (https://eln.labinform.de/) is based on Dokuwiki, a popular Wiki software has minimum system requirements and is easy to adapt to someones needs and the workflows.
* Extensive documentation about the ELN itself and the underlying principles can be found under eln.docs.labinform.de.
* It is a part of the LIMS  demo.wiki.labinform.de

Thanks to all participants and looking forward to meeting you at the next monthly meeting or event.
