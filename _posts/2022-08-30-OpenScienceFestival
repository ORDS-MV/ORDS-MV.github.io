# Open Science Festival in Hannover

On 30/31 August 2022, Leibniz University Hannover (LUH) and Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology (TIB) organized the first Open Science Festival in Germany.
The festival was inspired by the festival organized in the Netherlands: meet - share  - inspired - care (https://konferenz.uni-hannover.de/event/49/contributions/)

The agenda included panel discussions:
+ Open Science: just science done right!
+ Who owns science?

and a nice suite of workshops:
+ Moderne Wissenschafskommunikation
+ Wiki-edit-a-thon „Frauen in der Wissenschaft“
+ Open Science in der Energieforschung
+ Library Carpentry: OpenRefine
...
+ **Reproducibility Hackathon with Anja Eggert + Frank Krüger**

# ReproHack

With a ReproHack reproducibility hackathon - we aim to reproduce published scientific results. During the workshop, you will choose a publication (browse ReproHack papers here: www.reprohack.org) and run the code from published data. The aim is to re-generate figures and statistical results of the publication. Maybe or maybe not you recognise insufficient information. A ReproHack gives you the opportunity to understand the importance of careful documentation of the entire analysis workflow. You will learn from other researchers from different domains and levels of experience.
