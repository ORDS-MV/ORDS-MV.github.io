**Open Reproducible Data Science and Statistics (ORDS) is a scientific network in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Its goal is to bundle regional expertise in the fields of data analysis and statistics with open and reproducible science. The focus is on the exchange of expertise between doctoral candidates and postdocs, but all other interested scientists are also welcome.**

Due to the interdisciplinary character of modern data-driven science, the network explicitly addresses all disciplines.
Besides general questions of data analysis, statistics and reproducibility, the network also focuses on programming environments such as R and Python.
While R is mainly used for statistical data analysis and data visualization, Python is especially common in the application of machine learning methods.
Besides the actual data analysis, another central point is the management and versioning of data and source code.
Modern tools such as the Git version control system, Jupyter notebooks and Docker containers can be used for this purpose.

We want to meet at regular intervals and inform each other about current projects and methods in the field of data analysis and statistics.
Furthermore, we will organize seminars, workshops and other events e.g. at the Graduate Academy at the University of Rotock or with experts in the topics of ORDS.
